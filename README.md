A reverse shell is created using Python, which allows control of multiple compromised machines, also referred to as bots. Unlike traditional shells, a reverse shell initiates a connection from the bot to the controller, enabling management of remote hosts even behind firewalls or NAT. This method is widely used in cybersecurity practices for penetration testing and managing controlled environments in a secure manner.
